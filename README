schosche - School Scheduler 
------------------------------

schosche is a timetabling application with a lousy name based on logilab-constraint Constraint
Satisfaction Problem solver library and Django framework.

It provides a simple demonstration of a web based  staff & resource scheduling aplication 
with a very basic user interface. 

Timetabling is one of the np-complete problems and this application is not optimized to the max 
due to being a demonstration, which means it might take long enough to see your toddler grow up 
and go to college before the application stops running and returns a result. 

It may also be a good starting point if you know your timetable's constraints well.
